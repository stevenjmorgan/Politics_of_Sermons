At verse 17 he turns to discuss duties, mostly of a moral nature, which concern our relation not only to fellow believers but more especially to the world around us.Born again believers, members of the body of Christ, are new creations. A believer is a new man; therefore, we are to put off all the clothing, the garments (the life), of the old man [This is the lost man, the unbeliever, called \u2018Gentile\u2019 in this passage], and put on the new (born again) man. The Apostle Paul tells us that we are NOT to live like \u201cGentiles,\u201d and then in 1 Corinthians 2:14, he tells us why unbelievers CANNOT live like believers do, that is, in a spiritual sense. \u201cBut the natural man (called here \u201cGentiles\u201d) receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\u201d (1 Corinthians 2:14). The unregenerate man CANNOT receive the things of God because his heart is dead, his mind is blinded by the god of this age, and he cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God.Verses 17, 18, and 19 give us the picture of the unregenerate, and we are NOT to walk as they walk. By nature, the unregenerate has a mind filled with vanity. His understanding is darkened. The heart of the unregenerate is blind. He has no feeling toward God; he is given over to lasciviousness (sexual desires), uncleanness and self-indulgence.Commentary17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,In these three verses Paul summarizes the teaching he gives at greater length in Romans 1:18-32. It is sobering conscious-probing analysis. It describes the true nature of the world apart from Christ. It is a catalog of what we all are by nature. He puts a spiritual stethoscope to our hearts to let us hear that its beat is out of control.The use of the words \u201ctherefore\u201d and \u201cwalk\u201d points us back to the same words in 4:1{1]. \u201cTestify,\u201d a strong word of solemn appeal, means to insist or implore. The phrase \u201cin the lord\u201d suggests that Paul is conscious of such a connection with the Lord, that he speaks in the Lord\u2019s name and feels that his words are clothed with divine authority. The appeal itself is stated both negatively and positively. The negative part concerns the \u201cwalk\u201d of the Gentiles (17-19) [Gentiles, as used here, refers to those who have never had the special revelation of grace]; the positive part revolves around the concept of \u201ctruth [as it] is in Jesus\u201d (20-24).Paul insists that his readers must \u201cno longer walk as the Gentiles walk.\u201d He was saying to the recipients of this letter that they were no longer to live like the Gentiles. They were now \u201cfellow citizens with the saints\u201d and a part of \u201cthe household of God.\u201d Their daily walk must conform to their new relationship. \u201cNo longer\u201d implies that once they lived as the Gentiles. Now, however, they must renounce the life and wicked ways of their heathen neighbors, and make a clean break with the old bad ways of paganism.The apostle proceeds to enumerate some of the significant features of pagan life in the first century\u2014vanity, darkness, alienation, ignorance, hardness, loss of feeling, lasciviousness, uncleanness, greediness. It is a grim and revolting picture which he draws, and in many respects it parallels the statement of Romans 1:18?\u201cFor the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.\u201d The life of the Gentiles, which had once been theirs, is one of spiritual \u201cfutility\u201d with \u201cvanity of vanities\u201d written all over it.First, Paul speaks of \u201cthe vanity of their mind\u201d and their being \u201cdarkened\u201d in \u201cthe understanding\u201d (18). \u201cVanity\u201d suggest emptiness, futility, and purposelessness\u2014life with no real meaning, no goal. The thought is not that unregenerate minds are empty. It is that they are filled with things which lead to nothing. To have \u201cthe understanding darkened\u201d is to be without the faculty of discernment, to be unable to distinguish right and wrong.The language Paul uses here and in the other verses expresses his sense of authority as an apostle. He speaks emphatically: \u201cI say and testify in the Lord.\u201d Paul wishes to emphasize his position. His words constitute the solemn and binding testimony of an apostle speaking as the representative of Christ the Lord and with His full authority.Paul does not spare us in his acute analysis of our sinful condition. Notice the flow of his logic:Hardness of heart leads toIgnorance which involves beingAlienated from the life of God which leads to our beingDarkened in our understanding with the result that we becomeCallous andGiven up sensuality and thusGreedy to practice every kind of impurity18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:Next, non-Christians are described as \u201cbeing alienated from the life of God.\u201d They are held in the grip of spiritual death, separated from the life which comes from God. The cause of this estrangement is twofold; \u201cthe ignorance that is in them\u201d and \u201cthe blindness of their heart.\u201d Instead of the word \u201cblindness\u201d most modern versions have \u201chardness.\u201d The Greek word originally meant \u201cpetrifaction\u201d but came eventually to be used by medical writers to represent numbness, insensibility, and callousness. Here it means insensitivity to spiritual things.Apart from Christ\u2019s work the cosmos was destined to futility (Romans 8:20{2]). Apart from God\u2019s special revelation the human race was condemned to futility. It\u2019s every effort to solve the jigsaw puzzle of existence was doomed to frustration. Satisfaction and fulfillment of existence was doomed to frustration. Satisfaction and fulfillment sought in the creation rather than in the Creator, worshipping it rather than Him, became the high road to eternal disappointment.19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.\u201cBeing past feeling\u201d continues the idea suggested by \u201chardness\u201d (17). The word primarily means \u201cto cease to feel pain,\u201d then \u201cto cease to care\u201d\u2014whether through despair or through recklessness. In this passage it describes, a state of moral insensibility wherein one no longer feels the reproaches of conscience.Being thus destitute of scruples, pagan people gave \u201cthemselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all [every kind of] uncleanness with greediness.\u201d Two frightful words are used in this statement. The first is \u201clasciviousness,\u201d the Greek of which denotes lewd or wanton conduct which shocks public decency. The man who can be described this way no longer cares to hide his sin; it does not matter to him who sees his shame so long as he can gratify his desires. The word translated \u201cgreediness\u201d is built on a root which means \u201ctoo have more.\u201d The Greek word describes a disposition which has absolutely no regard for the rights of others. It is very wide in scope, being used sometimes in reference to material things (translated \u201ccovetousness\u201d) and sometimes of such things as sexual indulgence (translated \u201cgreediness\u201d), as here. \u201cIt is the spirit of the man,\u201d explains Barkley, \u201cwho does not care whom he hurts and what method he uses so long as he gets what he desires.\u201dWhile unbelievers may affirm that their rejection of the Christian faith is fundamentally a matter of intellectual integrity, Paul stresses that the rebellious disposition of the heart drives and directs the understanding. Thus the Scriptures tell us something about the unbeliever which he or she tends to deny, suppress and repress\u2014namely that their rejection of God runs contrary to what they know \u2018deep down\u2019 to be true (Romans 1:18-23{3]). Since this was once true of us we need to be reminded to be patient in our witness and to pray for the aluminating and regenerating work of the Spirit as we bear witness to Christ.Scripture and special notes[1} \u201cI therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,\u201d (Eph. 4.1)[2} \u201cFor the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope\u201d (Rom. 8:20).[3} \u201cFor the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.

There is no record of God speaking with Noah since He had earlier commanded them to enter the ark. They rode out the total destruction of wickedness without hearing God\u2019s voice.Previously God had told them to enter the ark & now\u2014at last(See :10\u2014\u201cwaited\u201d)\u2014Noah was told to leave the ark with his family.\u201cSpoke\u201d\u2014rbd daw-bar'\u2014Piel Imperfect\u20141) To speak, declare, converse, command, promise, warn, threaten, sing\u20141c) (Piel)\u20141c1) To speak, 1c2) To promise.

He was to do this so that the animals might again \u201cabound\u201d upon the earth., This they were to do by fulfilling their God-ordained directive to be \u201cfruitful & multiply.\u201dThus Noah exited the ark with \u201chis sons, his wife & his sons\u2019 wives.\u201dAlso the animals of all the \u201cfamilies\u201d present, exited the ark.

Then he who had received the five talents went & traded with them, & made another five talents. And likewise he who had received two gained two more also. But he who had received one went & dug in the ground, & hid his lord\u2019s money. After a long time the lord of those servants came & settled accounts with them. So he who had received five talents came & brought five other talents, saying, \u2018Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them.\u2019 \u201cHis lord said to him, \u2018Well done, good & faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.\u2019 \u201cHe also who had received two talents came & said, \u2018Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.\u2019 \u201cHis lord said to him, \u2018Well done, good & faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.\u2019 \u201cThen he who had received the one talent came & said, \u2018Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, & gathering where you have not scattered seed. \u2018And I was afraid, & went & hid your talent in the ground. &Look, there you have what is yours.\u2019 \u201cBut his lord answered & said to him, \u2018You wicked & lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, & gather where I have not scattered seed. \u2018So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, & at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. \u2018Therefore take the talent from him, & give it to him who has ten talents. \u2018For to everyone who has, more will be given, & he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. \u2018And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping & gnashing of teeth.\u2019\u201d1Cor. 4:1-5\u2014\u201cLet a man so consider us, as servants of Christ & stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. For I know nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness & reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each one\u2019s praise will come from God.\u201dRev 21:1-8\u2014\u201cNow I saw a new heaven & a new earth, for the first heaven & the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, \u201cBehold, the tabernacle of God is with men, & He will dwell with them, & they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them & be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.\u201d Then He who sat on the throne said, \u201cBehold, I make all things new.\u201d And He said to me, \u201cWrite, for these words are true & faithful.\u201d And He said to me, \u201cIt is done! I am the Alpha & the Omega, the Beginning & the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, & I will be his God & he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, & all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire & brimstone, which is the second death.\u201d\u201dSalvation is both present & future:Present:2Cor. 5:20-6:2\u2014\u201cNow then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ\u2019s behalf, be reconciled to God. For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. We then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain. For He says: \u201cIn an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.\u201d Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.\u201dJn. 3:3, 5-7\u2014\u201cJesus answered & said to him, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d\u201d.....\u201cJesus answered, \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water & the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, & that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, \u2018You must be born again.\u2019\u201dFuture:Rom. 13:7-11\u2014\u201cRender therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, \u201cYou shall not commit adultery,\u201d \u201cYou shall not murder,\u201d \u201cYou shall not steal,\u201d \u201cYou shall not bear false witness,\u201d \u201cYou shall not covet,\u201d & if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.\u201d*1Jn. 3:1-3\u2014\u201cBehold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of God; & it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.\u201dRom. 8:16-25\u2014\u201cThe Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, & if children, then heirs--heirs of God & joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans & labors with birth pangs together until now. Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.\u201dIllustration:My youngest daughter recently traveled by herself from Greensboro, NC to Carrabelle, FL(675 mi.)/She & her Momma then drove to Orlando, FL(300+ mi.) to meet other family/Praise God she had no trouble with the car!/Until she got to Orlando, when it started overheating/On Friday, they limped it into a dealership where they said they could not look at it until Monday\u2014She was supposed to return to Greensboro on Sunday/However, knowing she was from out of town & in a time pinch, the dealership had a change of heart & was gracious enough to have a mechanic replace the water pump on Saturday/She was able to leave on time!/But she was helpless to do anything until the dealership released the car to her!/God RELEASESApplication:?Your Salvation Realized as God RELEASES??
