Repository to analyze political communications in sermons

Much of the literature on political communication from the pulpit relies on surveys of members of the clergy and/or congregants. This approach implicitly assumes preachers and members accurately recall political content delivered during a sermon. Additionally, surveys are expensive, and often require the researcher to select one to two denominations to study at a single point in time. We lack a complete understanding of how members of the clergy across multiple denominations speak about politics. Additionally, we lack a vigorous empirical examination of how political communication from the pulpit functions as a reaction to a salient national events (i.e. legalization of same-sex marriage, presidential elections, or terrorist attacks). I gather over 150,000 sermons from across the US and across multiple denominations to test existing theories of clergy political communication with observational data. I am able to leverage the temporal aspect of these data as well as examine differences in political speech across denominations. While these data do not represent a random sample, important insights on the political life of clergy can be gained from this data source.
